# Crave Frontend

## Description

This is an app I built to help my friends decide where to eat when none of us knew.
The app works by creating a session with a host. The host chooses possible categories of food to eat. 
Once decided, the host will get a code to share with participants and the others can put it into their phone and the host can start the session. If the participants match a restaurant it will pop up onto the screen as the selected restaurant.

## Installation

Dependencies are installed using `yarn` and an expo session can be started using `yarn start`. 
At which point the app can be launched using React Native expo. Make sure a Crave Backened is setup and fill its IP address in a .env file with the key `SERVER_IP={YOUR IP}`
